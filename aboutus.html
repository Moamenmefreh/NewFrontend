        <p>
          Missouri family law group was first established as an attempt to level
          the legal playing field and make family law services accessible to
          everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agatha Gilbert had worked for both the private and public sectors and
          saw discrepancies in the level of care and quality of representation
          provided to what she referred to as the more vulnerable groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          More often than not, it was money that dictated which clients got the
          best legal care and enough resources to build a waterproof case.
          Agatha was convinced that quality family law practitioners should
          support those most vulnerable, rather than go after the money. Out of
          these frustrations, Missouri was born.
